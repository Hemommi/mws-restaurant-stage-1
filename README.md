# Restaurant Reviews

Restaurant Reviews is a static webpage converted to a mobile-ready web application. It is designed to be responsive on different display sizes and accessible for screen reader use. Service worker was implemented to provide offline experience.

## Instructions:

1.	Run application locally downloading as a .zip file or clone this project using:

    $ git clone https://github.com/Hemommi/mws-restaurant-stage-1

2.	In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.
3.	In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: python -V. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use python3 -m http.server 8000. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's website to download and install the software.
4.	With your server running, visit the site: http://localhost:8000.
